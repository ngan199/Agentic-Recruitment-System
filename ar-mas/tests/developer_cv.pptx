The contents of the file /my-text-extraction-project/my-text-extraction-project/tests/sample_cvs/developer_cv.pptx cannot be directly generated as a text representation because PPTX files are binary files that contain structured data for slides, text, images, and other elements. However, I can provide you with a description of how to create a sample CV in PPTX format.
